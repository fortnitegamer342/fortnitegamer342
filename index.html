    2.What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?
    the client initiates requests and the server responds with the output
	
    3.Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware components are part of the internet.
facilitate communication and transfer data within a network
    
	4.Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships.
model for data transfer that uses a set of communication protocols to connect devices on the internet
    
	5.List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.
    Web, file and mail
	
    6.What is hypertext?
    software system that links topics on the screen to related information and graphics, which are typically accessed
	
    7.How is “the web” related to the internet?
It’s a service that runs on the internet
	
    8.Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction.
client-server protocol that facilitates communication between clients and servers by exchanging hypertext documents 
    
	
9.What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?
HTTPS is more secure 
    
	10.Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.
Different technological advancements, user interactions, and how users engage with the web
    
	11.Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development.
               The have the same but different features at different levels, such as user interaction, content, and technology
	
    12.Describe the role markup languages play in the Web.
    allows people to structure and format content for various purposes
	
    13.Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages.
    They have different languages normally and the markup language is the start of the code/ task where scripting has extended the task.
	
    14.Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD).

15.List some of your own interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences.
    First of all, just being able to fix things (coded related) on the go if needed and making things easier. Second of all, making your life more free for the long run as you can work more with your computer to make things easier in the jobs to come, some of the possibilities to come with coding jobs are software developer and programmer. Last of all, as I learn more in coding I realize to this will not become the job I desire in the future because it's just not what I really like but the skills will definitely be useful for any job I pick in the future,
	
    16.Describe how CSE1210 may connect to your future occupational choices.
	
  This will be able to help me fix broken or failed websites with the code and skill that I have learned in CSE1210. With learning my way around Github and the other CSE courses this year many opportunities will await if I follow the path of coding in the future.
